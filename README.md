# This is the first half of the game, the second half has more game features implemented

Hack & Slash is a 2D game developed using Java, it is a simple and rudimentary game which compares 
to an early era of gaming, including video games such as Legend of Zelda, Super Mario Bros, Contra etc. 
Although gaming realism, computer graphics and user immersion in video games have progressed to a point 
where developing such games is pointless. This repository contains a video game project that is built 
from scratch without the involvement of game engines and covers basic yet elementary blocks of building
a game.
